Regenerate code from catalog.yaml and fix any resulting issues.

This command:
1. Runs catalog-gen generate to regenerate all generated files
2. Regenerates OpenAPI handlers
3. Syncs property mappings in editable files
4. Implements artifact support if artifacts were added/modified
5. Attempts to build the project

## Steps

1. Run the generator:
```bash
catalog-gen generate
```

2. Regenerate OpenAPI handlers:
```bash
make gen/openapi-server
```

3. Sync property mappings - Compare properties in catalog.yaml with the mappings in editable files and update them.

4. Build to check for errors:
```bash
go build ./...
```

5. If there are errors, analyze them and fix:
   - Missing imports: Add required import statements
   - Type mismatches: Update converters and implementations
   - Missing methods: Implement required interface methods

6. Verify the final build:
```bash
go build ./...
```
