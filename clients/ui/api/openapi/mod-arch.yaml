        due to a failed or cancelled execution.
         - REFERENCE: A state indicating that the artifact is a reference artifact. At
        execution start time, the orchestrator produces an output artifact for
        each output key with state PENDING. However, for an intermediate
        artifact, this first artifact's state will be REFERENCE. Intermediate
        artifacts emitted during a component's execution will copy the REFERENCE
        artifact's attributes. At the end of an execution, the artifact state
        should remain REFERENCE instead of being changed to LIVE.

        CANCELED means the execution is skipped due to precondition not met. It is
        different from CACHED in that a CANCELED execution will not have any event
        associated with it. It is different from FAILED in that there is no
