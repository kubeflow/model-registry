# Kubeflow Model Registry Roadmap

## Overview

The Kubeflow Model Registry project roadmap is tracked using [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/kubeflow/model-registry/milestones), following the Kubeflow Release Team's request: this approach has been recommended in order to maintain a detailed view of all the items intended for upcoming Kubeflow releases, organized by "themes". The roadmap is continuously updated as we make progress towards a Kubeflow Release.

## Current Roadmap

The current roadmap and upcoming features are tracked in our [GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/kubeflow/model-registry/milestones). Each milestone tracks specific or future Kubeflow release and contains the planned features, enhancements, and bug fixes. For each milestone, a GitHub Issue is typically attached serving as a Tracker record to provide additional details.
