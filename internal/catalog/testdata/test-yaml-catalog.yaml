    description: A decoder-only code model designed for code generative tasks
    longDescription: |-
      Granite-8B-Code-Base is a decoder-only code model designed for code
      generative tasks (e.g., code generation, code explanation, code fixing,
      etc.). It is trained from scratch with a two-phase training strategy. In
      phase 1, our model is trained on 4 trillion tokens sourced from 116
      programming languages, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of
      programming languages and syntax. In phase 2, our model is trained on 500
      billion tokens with a carefully designed mixture of high-quality data from
      code and natural language domains to improve the modelsâ€™ ability to reason
      and follow instructions.

    description: A fine-tuned model based on Granite 8B Code Base
    longDescription: |-
      Granite-8B-Code-Instruct is a 8B parameter model fine tuned from
      Granite-8B-Code-Base on a combination of permissively licensed instruction
      data to enhance instruction following capabilities including logical
      reasoning and problem-solving skills.
