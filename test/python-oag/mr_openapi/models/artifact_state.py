At execution start time, the orchestrator produces an output artifact for each output key with state PENDING. However, for an intermediate artifact, this first artifact's state will be REFERENCE. Intermediate artifacts emitted during a component's execution will copy the REFERENCE artifact's attributes. At the end of an execution, the artifact state should remain REFERENCE instead of being changed to LIVE.  See also: ml-metadata Artifact.State
